  # We now have three different implementations of FizzBuzz. One uses cond, one
  # uses case, and one uses separate functions with guard clauses. Take a minute
  # to look at all three.
  # Which do you feel best expresses the problem?
  # Which will be easiest to maintain?
  #
  # I think this implementation is the easiest to maintain.
  # def fizzbuzz({0,0,c}), do: "FizzBuzz"
  # def fizzbuzz({0,b,c}), do: "Fizz"
  # def fizzbuzz({a,0,c}), do: "Buzz"
  # def fizzbuzz({a,b,c}), do: c
  # I think the conditional best expresses the pattern, but not the most efficient
  # that may because of my past with OOP.

  # The case style and the implementation using guard clauses are different from
  # control structures in most other languages. If you feel that one of these was
  # the best implementation, can you think of ways to remind yourself to
  # investigate these options as you write Elixir code in the future?

  # Many built-in functions have two forms. The xxx form returns the tuple
  # {:ok, data} and the xxx! form returns data on success but raises an exception
  # otherwise. However, some functions donâ€™t have the xxx! form.
  # Write an ok! function that takes an arbitrary parameter. If the parameter is
  # the tuple {:ok, data}, return the data. Otherwise, raise an exception
  # containing information from the parameter.
  # You could use your function like this:
  # file = ok! File.open("somefile")

  def ok!({:ok, data}), do: data
  def ok!({:error, msg}), do: msg

  # Test commands:
  # Chapter12.ok! File.open("chapter_12.ex")
  # Chapter12.ok! File.open("chapter_121.ex")
